## Type Annotations Added

### Function Return Types
- All test methods now have `-> None` return type annotations
- Fixture functions have appropriate return type annotations (e.g., `-> Config`, `-> Path`)

### Variable Type Annotations
- Mock objects: `mock_app: Mock = Mock()`
- Configuration objects: `config: Config = Config(...)`
- Schedule dictionaries: `schedule: Dict[str, date] = {...}`
- Result variables: `result: Any = ...`
- Score variables: `score: float = ...`
- Error lists: `errors: List[str] = ...`
- Submission objects: `submission: Submission = Submission(...)`
- Conference objects: `conference: Conference = Conference(...)`

### Import Statements
- Added `from typing import Dict, List, Any, Optional` to all test files that needed them
- Organized imports with typing imports at the top

## Key Improvements

### Code Quality
- All test functions now have explicit return type annotations
- Variable types are clearly documented
- Mock objects have proper type annotations
- Import statements are properly organized

### IDE Support
- Better autocomplete and IntelliSense support
- Improved error detection and warnings
- Enhanced refactoring capabilities

### Maintainability
- Clear type contracts for all test functions
- Easier to understand test data structures
- Better documentation through types

## Compliance with Project Standards

### __init__.py Files
- All `__init__.py` files remain empty as per project standards
- No code was added to these files

### File Naming
- All files maintain descriptive names
- No generic helper or utility files were created

### Code Organization
- Type annotations follow the project's coding standards
- Import statements are properly organized
- No circular dependencies were introduced

## Testing Environment
- All tests continue to work with the existing `.venv` environment
- No changes to test execution or pytest configuration
- All existing test fixtures remain functional

## Summary
Successfully updated **49 test files** with comprehensive type annotations, improving code quality, IDE support, and maintainability while maintaining full compatibility with the existing test suite and project standards.
