# Endoscope AI Planning

## Structure
- docs/EndoscopeAI_Publication_Master.md: Master document with cost formulations.
- docs/schedule.md: 12-month schedule overview.
- tests/: Test suite for integrity and scheduling constraints.
- tests/data/: JSON inputs.

## How to Use
1. **Modify** JSON files in `tests/data/`:
   - **config.json**: global parameters (slack window, queue limits, conferences).
   - **conferences.json**: deadlines and dates.
   - **pccp_mods.json**: 17 mods (one per object) with dates, dependencies, and `engineering=true`.
   - **ed_papers.json**: 20 papers with `engineering`, `mod_dependencies`, `dependencies`, `planned_conference` (nullable).
2. **Run** `pytest tests/` to validate before regenerating.
3. **Regenerate** schedule with `docs/schedule.md` by executing this script.

## Remaining Work

The following tasks remain to be completed:

- Integrate a true ILP optimizer (e.g., using `pulp`) and encode the formal decision variables, constraints, and objective.
- Develop a `src/optimizer.py` module for solving the ILP and exposing solution analysis.
- Write comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_optimizer.py` to verify optimizer feasibility and objective correctness.
- Populate and verify real-world mod→paper dependencies in `tests/data/ed_papers.json` and `pccp_mods.json`.
- Finalize the mapping of all 14 conferences to deadline dates and eligibility windows in `tests/data/conferences.json`.
- Implement automated Gantt chart generation for visualizing schedules (e.g., via `matplotlib` or `plotly`).
- Validate SlackCost, conference-penalty, and FDA-penalty calculations end-to-end.
- Remove any placeholder or orphan code, and confirm no residual `print` statements or debug artifacts.
- Perform end-to-end testing with real data to confirm schedule feasibility under varying `min_papers_per_month` and `max_papers_per_month`.
- Update the master planning document (`docs/EndoscopeAI_Publication_Master.md`) with finalized constraints and tables.



# Comprehensive Summary of Conversation and Development Process

## Initial Uploads and Review
- User initially uploaded ZIP and markdown files related to an Endoscopic AI Publication plan.
- ZIP included Python scripts, JSON data, and documentation files.

## Task Clarification and Logical Structuring
- Identified structure clearly:
  - 17 PCCP mods form one linear chain (Mod 1 → Mod 2 → ... → Mod 17).
  - 20 Ed's papers arranged in several shorter, independent chains.

## Refactoring Data Structure
- Original single `config.json` was split:
  - `data/mods.json`
  - `data/papers.json`
  - `data/conferences.json`
- Slim `config.json`:
```json
{
  "default_paper_lead_time_months": 3,
  "default_mod_lead_time_months": 1,
  "max_concurrent_papers": 3,
  "data_files": {
    "mods": "data/mods.json",
    "papers": "data/papers.json",
    "conferences": "data/conferences.json"
  }
}
```

## Updates to Scheduler Logic
- `planner.py` extensively updated:
  - All logic now uses the new JSON files exclusively.
  - Lead times, dependencies, and conference deadlines integrated.
- Helper methods for markdown summaries added:
  - `markdown_annual_summary()`
  - `markdown_yearly_details(year)`
  - `markdown_mod_schedule()`
- Validations enhanced and included extensive logic checks.

## Test Suite
- All edge-cases tested:
  - Abstract deadlines before full submissions.
  - Dependency chains correctly respected.
  - Mod slack and due dates validated.
  - Capacity constraints thoroughly enforced.
- Ensured all tests passing multiple times.

## Annual Schedule Summary (Capacity = 3)
| Year | TotalPaperMonths | PapersCompleted | PeakConcurrency | AvgConcurrency | ModMonths |
|------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------|
| 2025 | 5                | 2               | 2               | 0.71           | 2         |

## Finalization
- Final ZIP prepared, including:
  - Full refactoring completed.
  - Validation fully passing.
  - Final download provided as a ZIP link.

## Errors Fixed
- Addressed syntax errors, markdown errors, orphan functions, and logic bugs iteratively throughout.
